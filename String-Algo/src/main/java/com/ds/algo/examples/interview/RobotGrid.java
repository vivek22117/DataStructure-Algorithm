Problem: We have an m x n grid. A robot is placed at the top-left corner of this grid.
The robot can only move either right or down at any point in time, but it is not allowed
to move in certain cells. The robot's goal is to find a path from the top-left corner
to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Not allowed cells have value True
